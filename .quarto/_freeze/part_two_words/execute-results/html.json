Google and Trip Advisor reviews in the Klang Valley, Malaysia\"\nsubtitle: \"Part two: Words\"\nauthor: \"Sean Ng\"\norganization: \"AIMdata\"\ndate-modified: \"11 January 2026\"\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## DRAFT: Words\n\nIn this second part of our analysis, we'll be doing some text analytics. To recap, we are using data scraped by [Ng Choon Khon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/choonkhonng/malaysia-restaurant-review-datasets) containing restaurant reviews in Malaysia on Google and Trip Advisor. Take a look at the [first part](https://aimdata-labs.github.io/google_trip_reviews_kl_site/) of this analysis to see the limitations. \n\nLet's first take a step back and get an overview of the most common bigrams (two consecutive words) that appear in Google reviews, broken down by rating.\n\nThere isn't too much in the plot below that is unexpected. However, it should be noted that our collective vocabulary, when it comes to restaurant reviews, is quite limited: \"nice food\" could indicate anything between three stars and five.\n\nService, and not just food quality, is a major determinant in one-star ratings. This perhaps could be one of the reasons why fine dining restaurants have higher floors and ceilings for their ratings than more casual dining options. \n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_two_words_files/figure-html/common-google-bigrams-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nWhilst ratings might be very lenient overall -- cheapening a five-star rating -- we can at least say that there are also qualitative differences between five-star and one-star reviews. \n\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n## One-star and five-star reviews of Chinese restaurants\n\nLet's dig a little deeper. As noted in the previous part, Chinese and Casual Western restaurants -- overall -- have the highest number of reviews and some of the lowest mean ratings across all cuisines. Let's take advantage of this by looking more closely at one single slice of the data. \n\nBelow, is a network graph of words used in one-star reviews of Chinese restaurants in the Klang Valley. The thickness of the lines between words indicates the number of times a word pairing has shown up in reviews. The transparency of the lines indicates the strength of the correlation between those two words. Key topics have been highlighted by me.  \n\nThere isn't anything too unexpected with these one-star reviews. We see a combination of quite undesirable experiences: smelly, pricey, not fresh, rude, long waits and poor quality. Additionally, service and the overall \"experience\" show up prominently as well (especially when it relates to events such as Chinese New Year, which often sees large banquets for friends, family and associates). \n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Click image for full size](./plots/google_chinese_1_star_network_graph.png)](https://github.com/AIMdata-org/google_trip_reviews_kl_site/raw/main/plots/google_chinese_1_star_network_graph.png)\n\n<br>\n\nLet's look at the flipside and see what reviewers said about five-star dining experiences in Chinese restaurants. As with the plot above, line thickness shows the frequency of the word pair and the transparency indicates the correlation. Key topics have been highlighted by me. \n\nWhilst five-star reviews of Chinese restaurants are much more numerous, we don't necessarily see a greater variety of expression (just more foods mentioned), we see that points of failure are very similar to points of success for Chinese restaurants: freshness, friendly service, waiting times and reasonable pricing. We also see a key phrase that we will delve into in a later section: \"highly recommended\". \n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Click image for full size](./plots/google_chinese_5_star_network_graph.png)](https://github.com/AIMdata-org/google_trip_reviews_kl_site/raw/main/plots/google_chinese_5_star_network_graph.png)\n\n\n\nAs a whole, Chinese restaurants seem to be judged by Google reviewers on quite a consistent set of criteria. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\n\n\n## Topic modelling and expectations\n\nSince reviews are so heavily skewed towards 5 stars, let's use topic modelling to break down reviews into just two groups which I have termed **Recommended** and **Everything else**. Below, the per-topic-per-word probabilities of bigrams in the Google dataset have been plotted. The x-axes indicate the probability of each bigram appearing in reviews under each topic. \n\nBigrams have been used here because individual words are not as informative (\"service\" vs. \"excellent service\"). As mentioned, our collective vocabulary is quite limited when it comes to food: \"fine dining\" is used both as a compliment and as a mocking pejorative. \n\n<br> \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_two_words_files/figure-html/lda-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nLet's take a closer look at individual bigrams. We'll start with some of the most common foods that show up in Google reviews.  \n\nRestaurants seem to have the worst performance with chicken rice, fried rice, char siew, dim sum and roast pork. Amongst cuisines, Indian and Italian food seem to be recommended more often than not; the opposite is true for Chinese restaurants. \n\nPerhaps reviewers are less generous with foods they are familiar with. I know I am: I've had extremely good char siew and roast pork (that can be easily and readily accessed) and can be uncharitable and judgemental when they are done poorly. \n\nStaying for dessert (\"ice cream\") does not mean that a reviewer was satisfied with the meal or would recommend a restaurant. \n\nGiven the low percentage of reviews that use Malay that we mentioned in the previous part -- many of the most common foods here are not halal at all. This underlines that the demographics of Google reviewers (who are already much more likely to be locals than Trip Advisor reviewers) are skewed heavily towards minorities. \n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_two_words_files/figure-html/common-foods-lda-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nIn this next plot below, we're looking first at some of the most common general descriptors (not specific to food) of restaurants. With the plots below, the important thing is to compare the relative per-topic probabilities of each of the bigrams.\n\n\"Friendly staff\" and \"nice food\", more often than not, are complimentary terms, but do by no means guarantee a positive review or a recommendation. Likewise, having a \"nice environment\" is important, but nowhere as important as having \"excellent food\" or \"excellent service\". \n\nBringing up \"food quality\" is more likely a pejorative than it is not. If service is very important to you, the terms \"excellent service\" and \"friendly staff\" are good distinguishers in Google reviews. Unfortunately, a lot of people to whom service is very important are unable to acknowledge this fact about themselves. \n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_two_words_files/figure-html/general-descriptors-lda-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, this isn't all that applicable to real life, since you can't search all reviews across all restaurants for keywords. Google Maps does not work the same way Google Search does (at leastt before it became useless). You can only search for keywords within the reviews of a single restaurant.\n\nThis is another point in favour of online reviews just being a marketing ploy. Not to say that marketing ploys cannot be informative, just that their information is compromised. \n\nThere is, however, one keyword search that does work. \n\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n## \"Highly recommended restaurant\" (sic)\n\nType in \"highly recommended restaurant\" (sic) into Google Maps (or \"recommended restaurant\" on iOS) and see what you get. I got a list of some pretty good restaurants, with no photos. I don't agree with every entry, this \"directory\" mode is probably the best performance I've seen from Google Maps in a long time. \nNow, this may seem like we've somehow gamed the system, but to bring us back down to Earth, this list of highly recommended restaurants is actually still part of the game, according to Gemini (Google Maps Support provided no real answers): \n\n>When you type \"highly recommend restaurant\" into the search bar, Google Maps interprets those words as keywords rather than a command. Instead of looking for a specific badge, the app uses its algoritm to build a list based on several \"trust signals.\"\n\n>1. Keyword matching (SEO) [...] \"This place is highly recommended\" [...]\n>2. High \"Prominence\" Scores. Google defines \"Prominence\" as how well-known or important a business is. When you ass \"highly recommended\" to your search, the algorithm prioritizes restaurants with: high volume of 4.5+ star ratings. Mentions on \"Best Of\" lists [...]. Heavy foot traffic (Google tracks how many people acturally visit the location). \n> 3. The \"Top Rated\" Filter. By using that specific phrase, you are essentially triggering Google's built-in Rating Filter. Google will automatically filter out businesses with low ratings (usually anything below a 4.0) [...].\n>4. Machine Learning & \"Your Match\"[...]\n\nThey have also included a \"Review Snippet\" so you can tell why a particular restaurant made it to this list. Also note from these screenshots that the actual rating is not that important: restaurants are in the range of 4.0 to 5.0, but that's about it, as if Google also knows that the mean rating is not a particularly useful metric. \n\nConversely, when you type in \"highly recommended restaurants\" or just \"highly recommended\", \n\n>the list looks different—often featuring large, swipeable photos—because Google switches from a standard \"directory\" mode to \"Discovery Mode.\" Google knows that when you use words like \"highly recommended,\" you aren't just looking for an address; you’re looking for an experience. \n\nWhen not in \"directory\" mode, the factors that Google Maps takes into account are not desirable (at least by me):\n\n>1. Visual \"proof\" of recommendation. Google's AI specifically pulls photos it identifies as \"high quality\"\n>2. The \"Discover Through Photos\" feature. [...] When you use subjective search terms (like *highly recommended*, *beautiful*, *cozy*), Google assumes yuou want to browse visually. \n>3. AI Dish Matching\n>4. High Engagement Signals. [...] Google rewards businesses that have high engagement. If a restaurant has 1,000 photos uploaded by customers, Google has a huge library to make the search result look more attractive and \"trustworthy\" to you. \n\nThis is likely why searching for \"best restaurant\" yields such poor results. You're probably getting results that are more easily manipulated and influenced i.e. upload a photo for a free ice cream. \n\nFor reference, Google Maps's base algorithm (which is used when you type in \"restaurants in area X\") relies on: \n\n>1. Distance\n>2. Relevance. [...] Category matching, [...] Menu and Attributes, [...] Open Now\n>3. Prominence. [...] Review velocity [...] how ofren peole are leaving reviews. [...] Web presence [...]. SEO strength: the ranking of the restaurant's actual website also matters. \n>4. Personalisation\n\nBut back to \"directory\" mode: even though you get more satisfactory results, bear in mind that the Google rating has already been taken into account twice: ratings are part of how Google calculates \"Prominence\" and the algorithm also applies a rating filter. \n\nThat it does not solely act like a keyword is likely to prevent more manipulation and SEO shenanigans. So far, I've only been able to trigger \"directory\" mode with this one phrase. What else can trigger *Directory mode* on Google Maps? In these trying times, could some variation of \"reasonable price restaurant\" work?\n\n\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n## Conclusions part two\n\nNormal searches on Google Maps leave you at the mercy of a highly-gamified system. \n\nFood is not just food. It is an \"experience\" that must be marketed and upsold to you. \nAre online reviews useful? Maybe 3/5. \n\nSearching an area in Google Maps for \"highly recommended restaurant\" (sic) in Android and \"recommended restaurant\" (sic) in iOS can trigger \"directory\" mode. \n\nRegarding fine dining restaurants having higher floors, with the bigram \"fine dining\" show up under 2-star reviews, likely because people are unwilling to give a fine dining restaurant a 1-star review. \n\nThe most common bigrams (two words) per rating have been plotted below. Unfortunately, they're very informative. \n\nWithin Trip Advisor, we see certain commonalities in the language used, irrespective of rating. Additionally, we see that Trip Advisor reviewers tend to pay more attention to service than Google. The bigram \"dining experience\" appears across all ratings. We see a lot of bigrams related to wait times (\"20 minutes\", \"30 minutes\" etc.) in one-star and two-star reviews. However, as with the bigrams in Google reviews, \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](part_two_words_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Appendices\n\n\n\"Hot\" and \"cold\" has to do with underprepared and/or microwaved food\n\n<br>\n\n[![Click image for full size](./plots/trip_casual_western_1_star_network_graph.png)](https://github.com/AIMdata-org/google_trip_reviews_kl_site/raw/main/plots/trip_casual_western_1_star_network_graph.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\"Cold\" shows up again under one-star reviews of Casual Western restaurants, indicating poor attention to detail and/or rushed food preparation. \n\n<br>\n\n[![Click image for full size](./plots/google_casual_western_1_star_network_graph.png)](https://github.com/AIMdata-org/google_trip_reviews_kl_site/raw/main/plots/google_casual_western_1_star_network_graph.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",

The median and mode for both datasets is 5.\nIt really could be said that the default review rating is five stars. This means that restaurant reviews on these platforms are quite lenient. It is hard for me to believe that half of all reviews were about truly exceptional dining experiences: 51.87% of all ratings in the Google dataset for the Klang Valley (KL, PJ and Shah Alam in the datasets) are five stars; in Trip Advisor, it was 52.79%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews are limited (in every sense of the word) to a one-to-five scale. In the scatterplots below, we note that almost all restaurants mostly receive five stars (blue) or four stars (green). This does seem to indicate that restaurant ratings are not very good at distinguishing between restaurants."

We’ll narrow down the scope to locations in the Klang Valley (KL, PJ and Shah Alam, in the datasets; since I’m most familiar with and most interested in this metro).\nDetermining the cuisine of a restaurant was mostly fairly obvious, and the categories hopefully self-explanatory. Additional notes on the coding of these cuisines may be found in the appendices.\nLet’s start first with an overview of both datasets, now with cuisines included. From the plot below, we see that:\n\nSouth Asian, Chinese, Casual Western, Japanese and Bars are the most commonly-reviewed restaurants in the Klang Valley. These are not the most common nor the most commonly-visited restaurants (hawker stalls).\nChinese, Casual Western, Malaysian and Thai are the lowest-rated cuisines.\nFusion, Other Upmarket (experiential dining or unspecified “international” cuisine) and bars have the highest ratings, with 60% or more of all reviews being five stars.\nTrip Advisor and Google reviewers differ the most on their opinions of Levantine, Casual Western and Japanese restaurants. With regards to Levantine food, in my opinion at least, it might be a case of “good for Malaysia”, but not necessarily good compared to outside of it.\nThe x-axes on the plots below show the percentage of reviews that are five stars by cuisine. This actually provides much more differentiation than just the mean rating (which is reflected in the colours below)."

    "text": "Restaurants in both Google and Trip\nLet’s investigate a bit more by looking at restaurants that appear in both the Google and Trip datasets.\nBelow, we have plotted restaurants based on their mean ratings on Google and Trip Advisor. The globalised nature (with such heavy representation from casual western restaurants) of the Malaysian food scene seems to result in Google (which is used more heavily by locals) and Trip Advisor (which is used more often by travellers) agreeing more than not.\nLooking at the top-right quadrant, we see that the restaurants rated most highly by Google and Trip Advisor are mostly fine dining: Sushi Hibiki is a high-end omakase restaurant and seems to be regarded as the best meal in the Klang Valley; DC Restaurant has one Michelin star. Sausage Kl Cafe and Grill, however, was a restaurant specialising in full English breakfast. And Antipodean is a cafe that is, to me, a solid 3.5/5; but it still has around the same Trip Advisor rating as Dewakan, which has two Michelin stars.\nWe’ll look into this more in next week’s section of the report, but it appears that the commonality of five-star reviews indicates that the mean rating might be more an indicator of expectations being met, than any true excellence.\n\n\n\n\nClick image for full size\n\n\n\nWhat becomes clearer when we re-plot the restaurants, this time using percentage of ratings that are five stars, the distinction between fine dining and more casual restaurants is much clearer. Fine dining restaurants tend to have above 50% of their reviews being five stars in both Trip and Google.\nThe restaurants in the “fine dining” group have higher floors and ceilings, when it comes to the percentage of ratings that are five stars. This is why lacking price range in this dataset is such a shame, as it seems like these two groups should be graded on their own curves.\nWe also see how Google reviewers are stricter (less lenient), with restaurants struggling to get above 70% five-star reviews. Though, as mentioned this isn’t any particular mark of quality.\nAlso to be investigated further is to what extent restaurants in the “fine dining” achieve their higher scores due to better service and environments, as opposed to food quality.\n\n\n\n\nClick image for full size"

    "section": "Conclusions: Part one",
    "text": "Conclusions: Part one\nLet’s review what we’ve learnt so far; though we probably already knew some of these things instinctually, it is still nice to get confirmation:\n\nReviews skew very heavily towards five stars. More than half of all reviews give five stars. This means that Google Maps and TripAdvisor are not useful in determining where one should eat since five stars could mean anything from “met expectations” to “truly exceptional”.\nRe-sorting (lowest, most recent) and filtering reviews will likely provide more informative reviews on Google. There is no real reason to accept their default sorting by “relevance” as you can pay for visibility, pay for reviews, and pay to remove reviews.\nHowever, this means that we’re still engaging with reviews as individual data points. Even looking at the review summary will not always be helpful, since having five-star reviews be less than 50% of your total is more an indicator that the restaurant is not fine dining, than any other indicator of quality.\nOutside of the home, hawker centres and coffee shops are places where food is most commonly consumed. Yet these businesses are not reviewed with anywhere the same frequency as the casual western eateries or chinese restaurants/dai chows. It is difficult (by design?) to mark individual hawkers since they operate from within the premises of another business. Additionally, hawkers are much less likely to engage with Google or Trip Advisor to curate or market their online presence, leading to these platforms being blind to the needs of hawkers and continue to cater towards restaurants (who might actual have marketing budgets).\n\nRare is the occasion that I, whilst searching on Google or Trip Advisor, find a truly exceptional meal. My most memorable experiences have mostly been the result of personal recommendations or curated lists from trusted reviewers. I’m starting to think that the main purpose of review platforms is marketing."

    "text": "Appendices\n\nNotes on cuisine\nWith reference to the cleaning script for determining the cuisine of a restaurant, there are few things to bear in mind in trying to update or improve it.\nI have made a distinction between Malay and Malaysian cuisines. This difference can be boiled down to Chef Wan (Malay) vs. Madan Kwan (Malaysian). A Hainan Kopitiam would be considered as Malaysian.\nA few more points for the ordering of arguments within the case_when statement:\n“Other Upmarket” is mostly expensive experiential dining, with some tourist traps. In this category are Dining in the Dark and Plane in KL. I’ve also included Turkish food under the “Levantine” umbrella.\n“Fusion” restaurants are explicitly fusion restaurants, with the word “fusion” in their names or showing up in a proportion of reviews. The same is true for buffet restaurants (which were numerous enough in the Trip Advisor dataset to warrant their own category).\nI have considered South Asian buffet restaurants to be South Asian restaurants. I And I do not consider hotel buffets to be a type of fusion restaurant, despite all the types of food they might serve. Additionally, when altering the cleaning script, make sure that the argument for grills is before that for bars (because of “barbecue”).\nThe Google and Trip Advisor datasets for the Klang Valley have a fairly comparable number of reviews: 77,864 in Google and 78,925 in Trip Advisor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip Advisor reviewers tended to review far more bars, buffets (including hotel buffets), cafes, fusion, Japanese and unspecified upmarket restaurants than Google reviewers. This is commonsensical since Trip Advisor tends to have travellers using it.\n\n\n\nReference tables\nBelow are reference tables for the restaurants used in this analysis.\n\nGoogle: restaurants in the Klang Valley\nSorted in descending order, according to mean rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip Advisor: restaurants in the Klang Valley\nSorted in descending order, according to mean rating."

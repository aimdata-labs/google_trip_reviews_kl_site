"1"," ""Disappointed with my lunch here last week. Pasta was tasty but super heavy and absolutely too rich, I left half in the bowl. I thought the dessert would make up for it... I was wrong. I ordered the bread and butter pudding with hot custard sauce. It came with a cold, milky sauce - which I sent back. I got a very similar sauce back which was more yellow. Still not convinced. I ate about one tenth of the slice... So oily and made me instantly feel off. I was given a biscuit for diwali upon leaving, but alas, even that tasted terrible. No rescuing this. Time to leave. It then took too long to get my change. Also, I left most of my main and dessert on the plate when they picked it up, yet nobody addressed it or asked \""how was it?\"".

"1"," ""Food cold, service poor, over-priced.......Souled Out has really gone down hill in the last year, and despite handing them 3 customer reviews to alert them of the poor deal, it continues to worsen. I have spoken to several people I work with about their experiences, and think it's about time Souled Out was removed from any list that recommends them. If I was to find a positive point, the freshly made pizza's are the only food worth asking for there, as they are fresh and hot. Souled Out needs to offer some staff training in waiting, food hygiene training, and a cookery lesson to the chef on how to cook......anyone can heat up or microwave food.

"1"," ""I would not recommend this place to others. This was my experience: We first sat inside, but the air conditioning was so cold that we ended up moving outside. A nice Indian man was serving us. We ordered a chicken pancake appetizer, which was like chicken friend in a delicious breading, which was quite good. I then ordered the seafood pasta, and my friend ordered the chicken pasta, neither which were supposed to be spicy. After we ordered a table of girls sat down at a table nearby and ordered, and we were a bit put off when they got their meals much quicker than we did. One of the women had ordered the seafood pasta like I did, and complained about how spicy it was, which made me nervous. My friend and I spoke of maybe her idea of spicy is very mild, and agreed that if I couldn’t handle the spice in my pasta, we would switch plates. We began to get slightly annoyed with the wait, but then they brought our entrees out and apologized for the wait. My friend began to eat his dish and commented that it was spicy. Literally as soon as I put mine in my mouth I knew there was no way I could eat it. It was literally probably the hottest thing I’ve ever put in my mouth. My friend saw my face and immediately took the plate and took a bite, and within seconds he agreed that it was insanely spicy, much spicier than the mild Thai food that we had, and we put it to the side to send it back. I’ve never sent back a meal before, but I cannot even explain the level of spice in this dish, almost like someone put harbenaro sauce all over it. The waiter came back and we explained, and he said that he would bring back one without spice. A manager went to the table of the girls next to us and they complained to him, and even pointed at my friend and said, “look at how hot it was, he was even sweating!.” It turned out that they had borrowed a cook from another restaurant who did not cook it correctly. By this point my friend had even decided the chicken pasta was too spicy, and set it to the side. When they finally brought the seafood pasta out we were starving and very quickly shared it and left. The seafood pasta that was brought out without spice and very little flavor. For the wait time and time and the inconvenience of everything we wish some food would have been taken off of our bill. Overall we really had a terrible dinner here and would not return nor recommend it to others."""

"1"," ""My experience was at the Tropicana branch. I ordered the pork steak, can't remember what it was but it was priced at RM38.00 and then the problems or the horror began:-(a) The steak arrived cold. Sent it back and it got a little warmer to an edible level.(b) Although I cannot be sure, I am willing to put a huge bet on the steak being pre-cooked. The reason being is that steaks that are freshly made would reduce in temperature from the outside towards the inside. In other words the middle and center of the portion of the steak should always be hotter than the outer portion. This steak was cold in the center despite being warmed. This to me can only indicate that the steak was precooked and then re-heated for service. Does RM38.00 not deserve a freshly made steak?(c) And there was hair in the food!! I am bald and my wife has long hair so who does this oily one-inch hair hidden among the midst of fries belong to? Again is it feasible to pay RM38.00 for hair in your food?The ordeal was too disgusting that although I feel sorry for the waiters that tried to offer me another plate I could not bring myself to eat further.Avoid at all costs.""
